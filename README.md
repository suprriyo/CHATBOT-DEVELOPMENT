# CHATBOT-DEVELOPMENT

1> CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIROMENT IN YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM USING COMMAND "conda create -p "env_name" python == 3.10 -y"

2> STORE THE API KEYS IN .env file ( I used Groq API key for faster inferencing)

3> DOWNLOAD ALL THE LIBRARIES FROM "requirements.txt" file in terminal by doing "pip install -r requirements.txt"

4> TO RUN THE APP, type in terminal "streamlit run "file_name.py", but before that activate the enviroment in terminal "conda activate env_name"

5> WE WILL SEE OUR STREAMLIT APP IS RUNNING IN THE LOCAL STREAMLIT SERVER.
